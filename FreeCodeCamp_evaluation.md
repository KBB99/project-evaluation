## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? __JavaScript__ <br>

1. What is the development environment? <br>

There are [instructions](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md)
 to set up freeCodeCamp locally on your own system. They say to fork and clone the respository onto
 your local machine and to simply install Git and your preferred code editor with ESLint setup.
Or to develop on Gitpod, a free online development environment.
<br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

Yes, [instructions](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md)
are here. Very easy to find them, as it is one of the first links on the CONTRIBUTING.md page. Instructions seem 
pretty straightforward, and clean formatting helps.
<br>

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

You can choose to run a Docker build (recommended) or a Local build to run freeCodeCamp locally. For both the
Docker build and the Local build, the project needs Node.js installed. For Docker build, you need Docker software 
as specified in instructions, and for the Local build the project needs MongoDB Community Server installed. 
There aren't instructions on how to install these modules, though links to them are included, but there are 
instructions on how to run these modules to properly setup the enviornment.
<br>

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
