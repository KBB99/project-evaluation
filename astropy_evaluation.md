## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
	BSD-3-Clause



## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

	Python

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	Meant for any machine running a version of Python. As long as Python is supported, so is this project.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	There is instructions right on the main page of the project. Installation assumes Python is already installed and
knowledge of the terminal Python commands are expected.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	Requires Python 3.6+, Numpy 1.16.0+, pytest 3.1+. This is for installation via the source code, not through the terminal automated command.


1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	The code does not look easy to understand, there are too many components. Reading the documentation is a MUST for this project.


1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	151K lines of code in this project, so yes it is a very big project.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	The repository does have tests, but the contributors are not expected to write tests for newly added code. It just needs to comply with the original.


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	Yes, including very thorough descriptions.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	There is documentation on the design of the program via the external site. 

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>

	25 commits to all branches within the past week.

1. When was the most recent commit? <br>

	Most recent commit as of day I am writing this is: March 1st, 2020 at 9:18PM


1. How many issues are currently open? <br>

	956 issues currently open

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	Approximately 8-12 hours issues remain open. Very fast response time.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

	Active is subjective but personally I feel that a response once in a few hours is sufficient to be considered
active.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

	They have "Good first issue" which gives access to beginners. However, away from that, labels are made for the purpose of identification
ratehr than describing the difficulty. Priority is mentioned, however.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>

	316 issues were closed in the past six months.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

	According to Github, 324 contributors are reported. 

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

	41 contributors in the past six months.

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

	62 open pull requests.

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>

	No, they actually get responded in the same day.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

	There is not much active discussion although the response from moderators is very very fast so if there was something confusing, the response would be there quite quickly.


1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

	453 pull requests were opened within the past six months.

1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>

	As I am writing this, last pull request merged yesterday, March 2nd.

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
	Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

	The contributing document is very user friendly. It is very clear and offers external links for learning how the workflow
functions in the community.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

	The CODE OF CONDUCT documents an honor code for every contributor to participate in. However, no specific consequences are listed which means it is contingent on the moderators of the repository. 


1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

	The responses are generally constructive. While it can be interpreted negatively, the moderators and other contributors like to offer questions to help justify any of the contributions someone wants to make.


1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

	People seem to be very friendly, however they want to understand the motivations of any contributions so they will inquire if necessary.


1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>

	Yes (with enthusiasm too).	

## Development Environment Installation

	Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>

	I just typed a command and Python did all of the work I wanted it to. Even external libraries.

1. how long it take you? <br>

	About 1-2 minutes.

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>

	I did, but python grabs it right away for you.

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>

	Yes

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>

	No

1. any other comments? <br>

	No


## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	This to me is very tricky. My knowledge of python I feel is too miniscule for me to be able to contribute appropriately. While the community is welcoming, this is the biggest obstacle I face and it does not help that this is a massive project.
	

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	
	In the future, possibly.
